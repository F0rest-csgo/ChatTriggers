## ChatTriggers

### How to use
1. Make sure you installed sourcemod and metamod on your csgo Server
2. Edit `addons/sourcemod/configs/chat_triggers.cfg` and add your new Chat Triggers.
3. Download .smx from [releases](https://github.com/MoritzLoewenstein/ChatTriggers/releases) and put it in `addons/sourcemod/plugins`
3. If you have a different Silent Trigger for sourcemod commands, set `sm_triggers_silent_trigger` to the new trigger.
4. If you still want to see the commands in chat, set `sm_triggers_silent_mode 0`

### chat_triggers.cfg

- If you leave the example in, `example` in Chat triggers the sourcemod admin command
- Just put you new trigger in quotes on the left side, and the command you want to trigger
  in quotes on the right side, but dont write sm_admin to trigger the admin command, 
  just admin like in the example is enough.
